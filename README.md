# Work In Progress

WorkInProgress is an PWA application that helps you track progress through your work especially when you are doing multiple things at once. It replaces notes that you have been writing into your calendar.

## Remind yourself tasks

If you are waiting for something/someone then just setup yourself a reminder with repeated notifications. Are you waiting for tests that usually take 30 minutes? Set yourself reminder in 30 minutes with 10 minutes repeat. Waiting for a colleague? 1 day reminder with 2 hours repeat sounds good?

## Save your workflow

Did you create detailed process and want to save it for later? No problem!
